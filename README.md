Telegram Profile Bot Template
This is a basic Telegram bot template designed to help new bot developers understand how to create and manage user profiles. It provides a simple, interactive way for users to input and update their personal information using inline keyboards and temporary data storage.

Features
User Profile Creation: Guides users through a step-by-step process to set up their profile (name, age, type, interests, goals, location, content preference).

Profile Viewing: Allows users to view their saved profile details.

Profile Editing: Provides an interface to easily update any part of their profile.

Temporary Data Storage: User data is stored in memory for the duration of the bot's runtime. (For a persistent solution, integrate a database like SQLite or PostgreSQL).

Inline Keyboards: Utilizes interactive buttons for a smooth user experience.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your own version of this bot up and running:

1. Get a Bot Token
You'll need a unique token for your bot.

Open Telegram and search for @BotFather.

Start a chat with @BotFather and send the command /newbot.

Follow the instructions to choose a name and a username for your bot.

@BotFather will then give you an API token. Keep this token secure!

2. Set up your environment
Clone this repository (or copy the bot.py code into a new file on your machine):

git clone <repository-url> # Replace with your GitHub repo URL
cd <your-repo-folder>

Install dependencies: This bot uses the python-telegram-bot library.

pip install python-telegram-bot

3. Configure the Bot
Open the bot.py file.

Find the line that says:

bot_key = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"

Replace "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" with the actual token you received from @BotFather. It will look something like 1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMN_OPQRSTU_VWXYZ.

4. Run the Bot
Execute the bot.py file from your terminal:

python bot.py

Your bot should now be running! Open Telegram, search for your bot's username, and send it /start.

Expanding the Bot
This template is a starting point. Here are some ideas for how you can expand it:

Database Integration: Implement a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user profiles persistently.

More Profile Fields: Add more fields to the user's profile to suit your bot's purpose.

Advanced Features: Introduce new functionalities based on the user's profile data.

Authentication: If building a multi-user app, consider adding robust authentication.
